# Diff In Pressure
A data analysis project from the 2024 Energy AI Hackathon

## Summary:

<text> This problem was originally done with a team of five. The objective of the problem was to solve a Petroleum and Gas Engineering (PGE) domain problem about differences in volume of liquid that was pumped into the well versus what came out. Using various factors such as pressure, type of liquid used, distance to other wells and age, we were asked to use Python and Machine Learning to give a recommendation to the judges (Industry Professionals).  In post, I continue to use our team solution, the winning teams solution and consequent resources given by the event's host to create my own solution. I simply found myself wanting to continue learning about Machine Learning with this problem. </text>
